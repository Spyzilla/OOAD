# Assumptions

We assumed the animals are asleep when added, and that the rollCall function would be achieved with makeNoise.

We also assumed copying the output from terminal and putting it in the dayatthezoo.out file would be alright, but we could also modify the code to actually output it to a file.

# Instructions

No special instructions are needed, simply run main!
